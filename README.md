## Story

Once comrades-in-arms, you and the other five generals were the epitome of power and unity, leading a formidable army to conquer lands far and wide. But as power corrupted the hearts of your comrades, betrayal lurked in the shadows. Without outward displaying powers, your skill alone was deemed a threat. In a cowardly act of treachery, the other generals conspired to assassinate you.

Reawakened from your dormant power, fueled by vengeance, you embark on a quest to avenge your betrayal. As you journey through the land, you will confront not only your former comrades but the grim consequences of their actions, as they descend into darkness and chaos.
